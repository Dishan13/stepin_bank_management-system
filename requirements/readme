SWOT ANALYSIS

STRENGTHS
1. The code is robust and executes well for the inputs given by the user
2. Fetches all inputs in from the user and provides appropriate output
3.This is compiled using cygwin gcc compiler and hence robustness and effeciency i taken care of.

WEAKNESSES
1. The code doesnt free the memory space after the end of execution.
2. The number of options available are less and hence limited operations are performed
3. Function pointers can be included to make the code more effecient and safe from external threats.

Opportunities
1. More functions and function pointers can be included.
2. More number of pointer variables and function pointers can be included.
3. More effecient and a code with lesser lines can also be implemented.

Threats
1. Lesser functions and pointer functions may lead to external attacks when implemented in a real life and a large scale
2. IDE and Compilers which has better versions can be used to obtain effecient results.
