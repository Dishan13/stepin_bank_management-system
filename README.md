# stepin_bank-management_system
•	This code is in C- programming language. A gcc-compiler that has a supporting IDE to run the code efficiently.
•	A simple bank management includes 
	creation of an account
	update information of existing account
	Transactions like credit or debit
	Check details of existing account
	Remove existing account
	View customer list
	ATM 
	And many more
•	In the written code, 
	PASSWORD - login
	ATM ACC PIN NUMBER - 1234
•	There are 7 choices to choose from to perform certain actions as mentioned above.
record.dat file is the input file that contains the existing account details

The code is run on Netbeans IDE with a CYGWIN compiler.

#SWOT ANALYSIS

STRENGTH:
The strengths of the code lies in the robustness of the environment the code is run along with the cygwin compiler. 
The code is effecient and is useful in understanding the application of conepts into a real-world problem

WEAKNESS: 
With the number of function pointers and lesser number of functions, the code is vulneraable to threats.
The lesser number of test cases add to the vulnerability of the code here.

OPPORTUNITY:
The application of the same code can be done for many more features unlike the only 6 or 7 opereations mentioned here.
More function pointers and functions can be implemented to make the code safer to be deployed in a real world situation.

THREATS:
As mentioned above, threats lie in the accounted function pointers, functions and testcases.

# 4W's AND 1'H

WHO:
Any person from a student to a professional can take up this project as there is a huge scope to implementing
more and more functions and features within a function and make the code more effecient and robust.

WHAT:
During the process of analysis of the code, enthusiasts can figure out how to work on a real-life problem, find solutions to any problems
and have workarounds for it. Analysis of how to implement a problem and apply the theoritical knowledge.

WHEN:
There is no particular moment to learn. This can be implemented anytime and is easy to implement on any IDE or Compiler.

WHY:
As metioned earlier, this can be used for analysis and for better understanding of the c-language.

HOW:
The objective is to implement theory to practise.
